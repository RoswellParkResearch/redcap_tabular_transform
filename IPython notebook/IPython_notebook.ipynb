    "We have chosen SQLite for implementation of the sample demonstration because of its excellent performance as it stores data in-memory.

    "The script below is used to create, insert and query the sample_redcap_data table. The sample_redcap_data table is the heart of the implementation as it contains all the data associated with the project. For demonstration purposes, we have incorporated the below functionality for a single project with a project_id of 225. But the implementation is designed to be extensible for a wide variety of databases that reside in REDCap. We have included 3 events for demonstration to illustrate how events are managed. Another column named record has a one-to-one mapping with patient_id wherein the column patient_id is included in another table named sample_patient_id. We are utilizing the python library named sqlite3 which has proved to be versatile in connecting to SQLite backend from python and also has excellent query performance.\n",

The function \"create_table_data()\" is used to create the table named \"sample_redcap_data\" and the function \"create_inserts_data()\" is used to insert the data. The data to be inserted is read from a text file named \"sample_redcap_data.txt\" the data stored in the text file is evaluated as a python expression as shown in the code where it is read in as a tuple. We are calling the function named \"executemany()\" to perform all the inserts at one go. \n",
